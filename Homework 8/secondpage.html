  <h3>The Prince's Tale</h3>
  <p>In the Valley of the Courts lives <bold>Andevere, the Autumn Prince</bold>. This fair prince was given a lake by the Winter Queen. Around it she placed seven beacons, configured in the shape of a finding dance's path. She bestowed alongside this gift a promise to the prince: <queenquote>"Light the beacons where they stand, little prince, and when all seven burn upon the shore's edge, you will be granted your heart's desire."</queenquote> The prince accepted his gift most graciously, and traveled to the lake. There, he fashioned a torch from the Heartfire, a boat of the whisperwillow, and set upon his quest.
<br />
As he set sail across the lake to light one beacon, and then another, a band of harpies would come and blow out the prior one. "The queen sends her regards," one said. "With wishes that you find temperance in these trials," another said. The prince tried to reason with them, but they grew angry and chased him, harrying his boat and snuffing the flames he lit on the beacons with mighty gusts of wind from their wings. So with tears of anger they chased him, and he fled in an endless circle upon the lake.
<br />
The worries only redoubled. As he continued to travel the shores with his everflame torch, the spirits of the water in the lake grew restless, and feared it would burn them. So the spirits took to the skies and rained and battered upon the beacons in terrible floods and storms, not only dousing the flames, but reducing the ancient stone to rubble. The spirits of the earth relished in the new mud they were given, and they made bodies for themselves of the stuff; but, as they did so, a mote of the everflame still burned within the very stone itself. So, as the spirits of the earth played with each other in their new forms, they eventually fell asleep. When they awoke, the vessels they inhabited had been made solid, binding them to the forms of pots and cups and bowls and statues they had shaped the days prior. It is said these speaking vessels can still be found and reasoned with; the forms these spirits made brought joy for a time, but more than a few would no doubt enjoy the freedom of the earth.
<br />
But not all beacons were reduced to rubble; in fact, one was spared. Old Leatherback, a proud and powerful being, looked upon his quest with envy and alarm. The Beast feared that if Andavere gained his heart's desire, Leatherback would be ousted or brought to ruin. So, he offered Andavere a crafty alliance: "Let me lend my might to your quest, little Prince," the Beast said. "Light one of your beacons, and I shall keep it most jealously from harm. I will not guard two, nor three nor any other of the seven. One shall be my charge, and under my eye it shall be carefully kept from all. Neither harpy nor storm nor any hand but mine own, shall lay upon it." The Prince, desperate for aid, agreed readily. But as soon as the bargain was struck, Leatherback snatched away the very beacon itself from the shores in his mighty talons, rendering it useless to the quest. It is said it rests, still lit, in the Beast's Lair, never to be seen or touched by another, lest they invoke his wrath.
