A Graphical User Interface (shortened to GUI) is an interface that relies on, as the name implies, graphical elements that contextualize information and user inputs. These are able to be designed to accomodate a variety of tastes and needs, and are generally more publically digestible than CLIs. A well-designed GUI focuses on intuitiveness, accessibility, and general user friendliness, but hyper-focus on those traits can lead to problems like difficulty accessing less-used features that aren't at the forefront of the GUI.

A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a (usually) monochromatic window filled with blocky lines of code that appear eldritch to the untrained eye, but these are used to produce and convey information in its raw, codified form for efficiency's sake. CLIs are the preferred medium for coders and others in need of administrative functions, but their near total sacrifice of approachability means that one must know what they're getting into beforehand, rather than having the opportunity of being guided through the process like a GUI might be able to offer.

In summary, if you want general users to access or administrate something digitally, provide it through a Graphical User Interface. If you want advanced users to have a standardized, administrative role, provide it through a Command Line Interface.
